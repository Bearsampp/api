\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
 {\texttt{ }} \doxysubsection{The PHP Interpreter}\label{README.md_the-php-interpreter}
PHP is a popular general-\/purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world. PHP is distributed under the [PHP License v3.\+01](LICENSE).

{\texttt{}} {\texttt{}} {\texttt{}} {\texttt{}}\doxysubsubsection{Documentation}\label{README.md_documentation}
The PHP manual is available at {\texttt{php.\+net/docs}}.\doxysubsubsection{Installation}\label{README.md_installation}
\doxysubsubsubsection{Prebuilt packages and binaries}\label{README.md_prebuilt-packages-and-binaries}
Prebuilt packages and binaries can be used to get up and running fast with PHP.

For Windows, the PHP binaries can be obtained from {\texttt{windows.\+php.\+net}}. After extracting the archive the {\ttfamily $\ast$.exe} files are ready to use.

For other systems, see the {\texttt{installation chapter}}.\doxysubsubsubsection{Building PHP source code}\label{README.md_building-php-source-code}
{\itshape For Windows, see {\texttt{Build your own PHP on Windows}}.}

For a minimal PHP build from Git, you will need autoconf, bison, and re2c. For a default build, you will additionally need libxml2 and libsqlite3.

On Ubuntu, you can install these using\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sudo apt install -y pkg-config build-essential autoconf bison re2c \
                    libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev
\end{DoxyVerb}


On Fedora, you can install these using\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sudo dnf install re2c bison autoconf make libtool ccache libxml2-devel sqlite-devel
\end{DoxyVerb}


Generate configure\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}./buildconf
\end{DoxyVerb}


Configure your build. {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/debug} is recommended for development, see {\ttfamily ./configure -\/-\/help} for a full list of options. \begin{DoxyVerb}# For development
./configure --enable-debug
# For production
./configure
\end{DoxyVerb}


Build PHP. To speed up the build, specify the maximum number of jobs using {\ttfamily -\/j}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}make -j4
\end{DoxyVerb}


The number of jobs should usually match the number of available cores, which can be determined using {\ttfamily nproc}.\doxysubsubsection{Testing PHP source code}\label{README.md_testing-php-source-code}
PHP ships with an extensive test suite, the command {\ttfamily make test} is used after successful compilation of the sources to run this test suite.

It is possible to run tests using multiple cores by setting {\ttfamily -\/jN} in {\ttfamily TEST\+\_\+\+PHP\+\_\+\+ARGS}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}make TEST_PHP_ARGS=-j4 test
\end{DoxyVerb}


Shall run {\ttfamily make test} with a maximum of 4 concurrent jobs\+: Generally the maximum number of jobs should not exceed the number of cores available.

The {\texttt{qa.\+php.\+net}} site provides more detailed info about testing and quality assurance.\doxysubsubsection{Installing PHP built from source}\label{README.md_installing-php-built-from-source}
After a successful build (and test), PHP may be installed with\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}make install
\end{DoxyVerb}


Depending on your permissions and prefix, {\ttfamily make install} may need super user permissions.\doxysubsubsection{PHP extensions}\label{README.md_php-extensions}
Extensions provide additional functionality on top of PHP. PHP consists of many essential bundled extensions. Additional extensions can be found in the PHP Extension Community Library -\/ {\texttt{PECL}}.\doxysubsubsection{Contributing}\label{README.md_contributing}
The PHP source code is located in the Git repository at {\texttt{github.\+com/php/php-\/src}}. Contributions are most welcome by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

Discussions are done on Git\+Hub, but depending on the topic can also be relayed to the official PHP developer mailing list {\texttt{internals@lists.\+php.\+net}}.

New features require an RFC and must be accepted by the developers. See {\texttt{Request for comments -\/ RFC}} and {\texttt{Voting on PHP features}} for more information on the process.

Bug fixes don\textquotesingle{}t require an RFC. If the bug has a Git\+Hub issue, reference it in the commit message using {\ttfamily GH-\/\+NNNNNN}. Use {\ttfamily \#NNNNNN} for tickets in the old {\texttt{bugs.\+php.\+net}} bug tracker. \begin{DoxyVerb}Fix GH-7815: php_uname doesn't recognise latest Windows versions
Fix #55371: get_magic_quotes_gpc() throws deprecation warning
\end{DoxyVerb}


See {\texttt{Git workflow}} for details on how pull requests are merged.\doxysubsubsubsection{Guidelines for contributors}\label{README.md_guidelines-for-contributors}

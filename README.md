# Bearsampp API Documentation

This directory contains the official API documentation for Bearsampp. It is the entry point for developers integrating with Bearsampp and for partners who need a reliable reference to the platform’s capabilities.


## What this documentation covers
- Overview of the Bearsampp API and core concepts
- Reference pages generated from source (endpoints, classes/types, files)
- How-to guides and examples to help you integrate quickly
- Versioning, environments, and common integration patterns

If you are browsing the generated site, use the left navigation and search to find topics. If you are viewing this repository, see “View locally” below to build the HTML site.


## Who this is for
- Developers building integrations with Bearsampp
- SDK authors and internal teams consuming the API
- Partners evaluating capabilities and requirements


## Navigation map (when viewing the generated site)
- Main Page: high-level overview and quick start
- Modules: logical groups of features/endpoints
- Classes/Types: data models and client library types (if applicable)
- Files & Namespaces: low-level API surfaces for library users
- Examples: runnable or copy-ready snippets

Tip: Use search to jump directly to endpoints, types, or guides.


## Quick start (integration outline)
1) Credentials
- Obtain API credentials from your Bearsampp account or administrator.

2) Environment and base URL
- Choose the correct environment (production/sandbox) and note the base URL.
  - Example: https://api.bearsampp.example.com/v1 (replace with your actual base URL)

3) First request (pattern)
- Use your preferred HTTP client. Example (curl pattern):
```
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.bearsampp.example.com/v1/health" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```
Replace the URL and authentication header with your project’s actual values. See the Authentication guide and the endpoint’s reference page for exact details.

4) Handle responses
- Expect standard HTTP status codes; error payloads include a machine-readable code and message. See the Errors guide for specifics.

5) Next steps
- Implement pagination, retries/backoff, and idempotency where required.
- Explore the “Modules” section to discover available resources and workflows.


## Key topics to read
- Authentication: how to obtain and use credentials
- Errors and status codes: common failure modes and recovery
- Rate limits and retries: best practices to stay within limits
- Webhooks/Events (if available): reacting to changes in near real-time
- Changelog: releases, deprecations, and migration notes


## Versions and compatibility
- The documentation aligns with the corresponding codebase version.
- If versioned docs are enabled, use the version selector in the generated site to view historical releases.


## View locally (optional)
If you need to build and browse the docs locally:
- Ensure Doxygen is installed (and Graphviz if you want diagrams).
- From this folder, run: `doxygen Doxyfile`
- Open the generated HTML index reported by Doxygen (commonly `html/index.html` or `docs/build/html/index.html`, depending on configuration).

Note: The landing page is provided by the main page file (commonly `docs/mainpage.md`).


## Repository layout (convention)
- docs/ — Markdown guides, images, and the main page for the generated site
- src/ — Source code annotated for reference pages
- Doxyfile — Configuration used to produce the documentation site


## Support and feedback
- If something is unclear or appears incorrect, open an issue in this repository and include the page/endpoint you were reading and a short description of the problem.
- For security-sensitive questions, use your organization’s private support channel.
